This repo demonstrates how to use [What3words ArcGIS Locator](https://developer.what3words.com/tools/gis-extensions/arcgis) with the [AMD modules via ArcGIS CDN](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/install-and-set-up/).

## The advantages of using the CDN(AMD) include:

    Fast download and highly optimized caching for the API modules;
    No installation or configuration;
    Easy to update applications to the next API version.
